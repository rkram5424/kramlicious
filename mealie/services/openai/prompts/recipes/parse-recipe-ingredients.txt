Parse ingredient strings into components. You will receive a list of one or more ingredients.

When parsing:
- If uncertain about quantity, unit, or food, put the entire string in the note field
- Respect grammar rules for multiple languages
- Interpret singular/plural/grammatical variations
- Text in parentheses = notes (e.g., "3 potatoes (roughly chopped)" → note: "roughly chopped")
- Correct common typos (e.g., "potatos" → "potatoes")
- Recognize units: tablespoon, teaspoon, gram, tsp, tbsp, oz, sprig, can, bundle, bunch, unit, cube, package, pinch
- For ranges (e.g., "3-5", "1 to 2"), use the lower number
- All text must appear somewhere, or otherwise be accounted for; if converting "2 dozen" → "24", don't put "dozen" elsewhere. If you're unsure, put extra text in the notes
